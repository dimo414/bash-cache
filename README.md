# Bash Cache

Bash Cache provides a transparent mechanism for caching, or memoizing,
long-running Bash functions.

Originally part of [ProfileGem](http://hg.mwdiamond.com/profilegem) and
[prompt.gem](http://hg.mwdiamond.com/prompt.gem), this functionality has been
pulled out into a standalone utility.

## Installation

Simply `source bash-cache.sh` into your script or shell.

## Functions

### `bc::cache`

### `bc::copy_function`

### `bc::on` and `bc::off`
